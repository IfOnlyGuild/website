This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run these scripts you will need Yarn. You can find install instructions from [here](https://yarnpkg.com).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Fetch build dependencies from [npmjs](https://npmjs.com).
Do this the first time you clone the repository, or if you are getting unknown module errors.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
